# 42-Piscine-C

Hello,

Please only use this for refrence and to better understand C. 

Not all of my published exercises passed Moulinette. 
In each folder I placed an eval_trace file. 
Inside you will find my performance for that day along the top, and the trace for the grade below.

**Make sure you completely understand any code you submit**
** Including on how to recreate it in an exam environment.

After all, it would be odd to submit complex assignments, yet fail the first question on the exam.
